At this time the only dependency of this project is `discord.py`.
To install it, run the following command:
```
pip install discord.py
```

You will also need to generate a discord bot token to use this script, that can be done in the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)  

Put your token in an environment variable named `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`  

To run the program, just run the `main.py` file with:
```
python3 main.py
```
